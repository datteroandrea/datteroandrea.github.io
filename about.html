                <p>Hi! I am Andrea D'Attero here you will find everything you need to know about my life!</p>
                <p>Let's start from the begginning...</p>
                <p class="title has-text-centered is-italic">Birth and Childhood</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Birth</p>
                <p>I was born in 11/10/2000 at Dolo a small city of Venice, Italy.</p>
                <p>I was born with my eyes open, i have always been a curious kid, so i wanted to understand what was happening in this new world as fast as i could...</p><br>
                <p class="subtitle">Childhood</p>
                <p>At the age of 6 i started going to elementary school and like every other kid i totally hated that!</p>
                <p>I have always been interested in science, but i didn't know what branch i was going to pick, one thing for sure, I LOVED VIDEOGAMES and Computers so i guess my destiny was already written...</p>
                <p>As a 2000's kid i loved Dragon Ball and Spider Man and always dreamed about one day becoming a superhero!</p>
                <p>I was also A LOT into writing and i wrote many non-released books about superheroes and mystery (mainly inspired by Dragon Ball, Naruto, Spider Man and also Conan The Detective!)</p>
                <p class="title has-text-centered is-italic">It's time to grow up!</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Middle School</p>
                <p>Soooo after 5 long years i got into middle school and guess what? I again totally hated that!</p>
                <p>Middle school was BAD, i didn't know what i was going to do in the future and had A LOT of normal adolescence problems.</p>
                <p>Eventually after 3 long years i graduated middle school and choose the IT path.</p><br>
                <p class="subtitle">High School</p><br>
                <p class="subtitle is-6">Levi Mirano</p>
                <p>The first two years of High School i went to Levi High School.</p>
                <p>Here i made lots of friends and started forging my future!</p>
                <p>After 2 years at Levi i moved to another school and there everything of my life changed in an irreversible way!</p><br>
                <p class="subtitle is-6">Carlo Zuccante</p>
                <p>The last three years of High School were AMAZING!</p>
                <p>I made unforgettable friendships, experiences and learned everything i need to know to get started with the future!</p>
                <p class="title has-text-centered is-italic">Aaaaand now???</p>
                <p>At the last year of the High School everything smelled different...</p>
                <p>Everything smelled new it was like the future was now!</p>
